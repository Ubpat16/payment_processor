# payment_processor

Hi Everyone, This is a basic payment processor with User profile that simulates realtime popular online payment platform. Basically, The software is so simple that it uses only built in python packages.
To start the program, Run Main.py, and follow the prompt in your console, It is as simple as that. If you see any bug which I know there will be tonns of it, Don't worry, I am still working on it to make it as perfect as it can be. 

For now, an attaboy will buy me a beer.

Cheers!.
